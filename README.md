# Steam Game Data Project

This project is an exploration of working with messy real-world data. Starting with a raw CSV of Steam games, I aim to clean and prepare the dataset using Python so that I can analyze it and answer specific questions about game trends, patterns, and player behavior.

Right now, the focus is on cleaning: fixing formatting issues, handling null values, and making sure the data is structured and usable. Once the dataset is clean, I plan to define a few focused questions and use the data to investigate and answer them.

This project is also a way to learn more about building a basic data pipeline — going from raw input to insights — while practicing core data skills like preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.
