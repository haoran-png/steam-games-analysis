# Steam Game Data Analysis (2025)

This project explores a dataset of Steam games from 2025 to understand what makes some games more popular, better rated, or more engaging than others. The analysis looks at questions such as whether newer games receive better reviews, which genres keep players active, and how pricing relates to playtime.  

---

## Focus Questions
- To what extent do game genres influence user ratings and playtime?
- What price ranges best balance ownership with player engagement?
- Which tags are most strongly associated with highly rated or widely owned games?
- How have patterns in user reviews changed across release periods?
- Which developer strategies consistently lead to highly rated titles?

## Tools
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pathlib` (data cleaning and file handling)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: reproducible workflow for analysis  
- **SQL**: querying and exploration  
- **BI Tool**: dashboards and visual summaries (e.g., Tableau or Power BI)
