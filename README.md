# Steam Game Data Analysis (2025)

This project analyzes a dataset of Steam games from 2025 to explore what drives popularity, ratings, and engagement. The study examines review trends, genre performance, pricing effects, and developer strategies to identify patterns behind successful titles.

---

## Focus Questions
- How do different game genres influence both player satisfaction and long-term engagement, and are certain genres consistently under or overperforming relative to others?
- How does pricing affect both reach and engagement, and where is the “value-for-money” sweet spot across the market?
- Which tags are most predictive of strong adoption or high ratings, and do certain tag combinations amplify or dilute success?
- How have user sentiment and rating trends shifted across release periods, and are newer games reviewed more critically or more favorably than older ones?
- Which developer strategies are most consistently linked to highly rated or widely adopted titles?

## Tools
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pathlib` (data cleaning and file handling)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: reproducible workflow for analysis  
- **SQL**: structured exploration and querying
- **Power BI**: interactive dashboards and visual summaries
